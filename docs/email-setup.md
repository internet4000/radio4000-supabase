### Emails setup

Supabase will send out emails for you, but they are heavily rate-limited. 

You really need to configure custom SMTP, as soon as you have users.

- Find the transactional email service you dislike the least. We use Brevo
- Go to the 'Authentication' page, find 'Enable custom SMTP' and configure it.
